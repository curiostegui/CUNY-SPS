0,MELFI,Mr. Soprano'?
1,MELFI,Have a seat.
2,MELFI,"My understanding from your family physician, Dr. Cusamano, is you collapsed? Were unable to breathe? Possibly a panic attack?"
3,TOMMY,They said it was a panic attack -- because all the neurological work and blood came back negative. They sent me here.
4,MELFI,You don't agree you had a panic attack?
5,MELFI,How are you feeling now?
6,TOMMY,Now? Fine. I' back at work.
7,MELFI,What line of work are you in?
8,TOMMY,Waste management consultant.
9,TOMMY,"Look, it's impossible for me to talk to a psychiatrist."
10,MELFI,Any thoughts at all on why you blacked out?
11,TOMMY,"I don't know. Stress, maybe?"
12,MELFI,Stress? About what?
13,TOMMY,"Well, I once heard some guy use this expression, 'The sun setting over the empire?'"
14,TOMMY,"That morning of the day. I got sick? I'd been thinking: it's good to be in a thing from the ground floor. I came too late for that, I know. But lately I'm getting the feeling Imight be in at the end. That the best is over."
15,MELFI,"Many Americans, I think, feel this.	*"
16,TOMMY,Take my father. He never reached the heights like me. But in ways he had it better. He had his people -- they had their standards. They had pride. Today what do we got?
17,MELFI,Did you have this feeling of loss more acutely in the hours before you collapsed?
18,TOMMY,"I dunno. Couple months before all this these two wild ducks had landed in my pool. Amazing. From Canada or someplace, I don't know It was mating season."
19,TOMMY,Yum. Yum.
20,TOMMY,"My daughter's friend was there to drive my daughter, Meadow, to school."
21,HUNTER,"Meadow, your father with those ducks."
22,CARMELA,"Have something more than just apple juice, ladies. You need brain food for school."
23,HUNTER,The male and female duck just made a home in your pool and 'did it'? Weird.
24,CARMELA,"Girls, you want some of last night's sfogliatell'?"
25,MEADOW,Get out of here with that fat.
26,CARMELA,"Oh, have a bite."
27,MEADOW,Wait -- like Italian pastry is brain food?
28,HUNTER,Bon Jovi? Hello?
29,HUNTER,"How do you stay so skinny, Mrs. Soprano?"
30,CARMELA,Him. With those ducks.
31,TOMMY,Don't you worry. I'll make you a better ramp.
32,TOMMY,Kids! Come here!
33,TOMMY,"Hey, kids!"
34,TOMMY,Look! They're trying to fly
35,KIDS,"Nice, dad."
36,HUNTER,It is so cool you're going to be able to come to Aspen with my family at Christmas. Last year at Aspen? I saw Skeet Ulrich. As close as from where you're sitting.
37,MEADOW,Omigod
38,TOMMY,My wife feels this friend of Meadow's is a bad influence.
39,CARMELA,"Miss Meadow, we made a deal -- you keep your school grades up and you keep your curfew between now and Christmas -- then you get to go"
40,MEADOW,I know that.
41,TOMMY,"Happy birthday, son."
42,CARMELA,"You're going to be home tonight for Tommy Jr.'s party, right? Birdman. Hello?"
43,TOMMY,I'll get home from work early.
44,CARMELA,"I wasn't talking about work.	*"
45,TOMMY,This isn't going to work. I can't talk about my personal life.
46,MELFI,"It's hard for everybody.	*"
47,TOMMY,"You don't understand.	*"
48,MELFI,Finish telling me about the day you collapsed.
49,TOMMY,"I rode to work with my nephew, Christopher he's learning the business."
50,TOMMY,He's an example of-what I was saying before --
51,TOMMY,You call whatsisname at Triboro Towers about the hauling contract?
52,CHRIS,I got home too late last night. I didn't want to wake the man up.
53,TOMMY,You get up early this morning and call? He's always in the office at six .
54,CHRIS,I was nauseous this morning. My mom told me I shouldn't even go in today.
55,TOMMY,"Bear in mind, this is a kid who just bought himself a 60,000 dollar Lexus."
56,CHRIS,It's that guy. Mahaffey.
57,TOMMY,Get out.
58,CHRIS,Back there. See? With the boo-boo in red?
59,TOMMY,Back up.
60,TOMMY,There was an issue of an outstanding loan
61,MELFI,Let me stop you a second.
62,TOMMY,Sure.
63,MELFI,I have no idea where this story is going but there are a few ethical ground rules we should quickly get out of the way.
64,MELFI,You said you were in waste management?
65,TOMMY,Recycle. The environment.
66,MELFI,"Dr. Cusamano, besides being your family physician, is also your next door neighbor. See what I'm saying?	*"
67,TOMMY,"I get it. Yeah.	*"
68,MELFI,"What you tell me in'here falls under doctor/patient confidentiality. Except -- if I was, ï¿½for example, to hear that a say a murder was about to take place ---- not that I'm saying -- but, ifï¿½. Well, anything like that wherea patient tells me someone is going to be hurt? I'm supposed to go to the authorities. Technically."
69,TOMMY,Oh.
70,MELFI,I don't know what happened with this Mahaffey fellow. I'm just saying.
71,TOMMY,I see. Nothing. We had coffee.
72,MAHAFFEY,Security!
73,MAHAFFEY,"My leg! It's broken! Oh fuck; oh fuck, the bone's coming through!"
74,TOMMY,I'll .give you a fuckin' bone. Where's my money?
75,MAHAFFEY,I'll get the money!
76,TOMMY,I know you'll get the --The fuck you doing? Get over here.
77,TOMMY,I know you'll get the money. What you ought to fuckin' get is a fuckin' cork to put in your mouth. 
78,TOMMY,Huh'? You tell people I'm nothin' to worry about compared to who used to run things'?
79,MAHAFFEY,"I'm sorry, I'm sorry"
80,MAHAFFEY,My leg. Ohmigod! Fuck!
81,TOMMY,HMO. What are you fuckin' crying about? At least you're covered.
82,CHRIS,What you thinking about'?
83,TOMMY,HMO's.
84,CHRIS,Homos?
85,TOMMY,"HMO! HMO! It's a medical care provider. Read a fuckin' paper once in a while, Christopher."
86,MELFI,So you had coffee.
87,TOMMY,Right.
88,MELFI,Go on.
89,TOMMY,"Next? Let's see, I had a breakfast meeting."
90,TOMMY,So what's going on at Triboro Towers?
91,BIG PUSSY,The site manager wants to renew his contract with Dick. But this Kolar Sanitationï¿½..
92,DICK BARONE,Nationwide company.
93,BIG PUSSY,"The Kolar brothers, they're some kind of Czechoslovakian immigrants or some shit ---- these polacks'll haul the paper, plastic and aluminum for seventy-five thousand a month less than Dick."
94,TOMMY,So Kolar pays you the regular forty times the monthly for stealing your stop.
95,BIG PUSSY,"That's the thing -- he won't. Says if he could tell the Commie bosses back in Czechoslovakia to go fuck themselves, he can fuckin' tell us."
96,TOMMY,"Fucking garbage business.ï¿½	*"
97,BIG PUSSY,"I know. It's all changing.	*"
98,CHRIS,Let me see what I can do.
99,TOMMY,You sure? You over your stomach ache?
100,SILVIO,Gabriella sends me down here for the gabagool.
101,PAULIE WALNUTS,Best in the area.
102,SILVIO,"Tom, I'm thinking: did you go to elementary school with a guy named Artie Bucco?"
103,TOMMY,So this situation came up. It involves my uncle. I can't go into detail on this one.
104,MELFI,That's fine.
105,TOMMY,"But I'll say this -- my uncle adds to my general stress level.	*"
106,SILVIO,"Probably none of my business,.but down at the ..club, the word is your Uncle Junior is going to whack Little Pussy Malanga"
107,SILVIO,...in your friend Artie Bucco's restaurant.
108,TOMMY,"Uncle Jun', how .you doing?"
109,JUNIOR,"I was just talking about you. Jr.'s birthday dinner tonight, right?"
110,TOMMY,Don't buy him anything big. We overindulge him.
111,TOMMY,Arthur! What's the word at land of a thousand clams?
112,ARTHUR,Jefe.
113,CHRIS,You know what that means for Arthur one of these old mutts gets wet in here?
114,TOMMY,Ruin his business.
115,CHRIS,You better sit down with your uncle.
116,TOMMY,"Uncle Junior is my father's.brother. A good guy, but old now and crabby. He used to take me to Yankee games when I was a kid., -I love my uncle."
117,TOMMY,"At the same time, Uncle Junior also told our girl cousins I would never be a varsity athlete. I found out he'd said that and, frankly, it was a tremendous blow to my self-esteem."
118,VOICE,Who's there?
119,TOMMY,"It's me, mom."
120,LIVIA,Who are you?
121,TOMMY,"Ma, open the door!"
122,VOICE,Tommy?
123,TOMMY,"Ma, open the door!"
124,TOMMY,"Jeez, ma, get some air in here."
125,LIVIA,Did you lock the door behind_. you?
126,TOMMY,Yes.
127,LIVIA,Somebody phoned me 1ast night. After dark.
128,TOMMY,Who?
129,LIVIA,You think I'd answer the phone? It was dark out.
130,TOMMY,"Ma, that I will never get. The phone is an auditory thing. Dark is an eye thing. Some -people won't go out after dark -- okay -- get jumped from the shadows -- but not answer the phone after dark?"
131,LIVIA,Listen to him. He knows everything. You want some lunch? I got eggplant.
132,TOMMY,I just ate.
133,TOMMY,Know who I just saw? Uncle Junior.
134,LIVIA,That one. Think he ever comes to see his sister-in-law?
135,TOMMY,Remember Artie Bucco? My friend in elementary school?
136,LIVIA,I still see his mother. She tells me he calls her every day.
137,TOMMY,Thing is .ï¿½Uncle Juniorï¿½ï¿½ï¿½he's gonna make a problem for Arthur. It would impact on Arthur's livelihood.
138,LIVIA,What's that?
139,TOMMY,CD player.
140,LIVIA,For who? For me? I don't want it.
141,TOMMY,"You love music. All the old stuff's being reissued on CD, your favorites.Lookï¿½ï¿½ï¿½Connie Francisï¿½ï¿½ï¿½'Pejama Game'ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½"
142,TOMMY,"Ma, you need something to occupy your mind. When dad died you were going to do all kinds of things"
143,LIVIA,He wasï¿½a saint.
144,TOMMY,"I know, but he's gone. You were going to do volunte r work, travel. You've done nothing."
145,LIVIA,Don't you tell me how to live. You shut up.
146,TOMMY,I worry about you.
147,LIVIA,Don't you start with that nursing home again!
148,TOMMY,It is not a nursing home. How many times I have to say it? It's a 'retirement community'. You're with active seniors your own age. They do things. They go places. ï¿½
149,LIVIA,"I've seen these women in these nursing homes. In these wheelchairs. Babbling like idiots. Eat your eggplant.	ï¿½"
150,TOMMY,I told you I just ate lunch! Maybe you could talk to Uncle Jun' about Artie Bucco. He respects you.ï¿½ï¿½
151,LIVIA,If your uncle has business with Arthur then he knows what he's doing
152,TOMMY,And I don't'?
153,LIVIA,All I know is girls take better care of their mothers than son.
154,TOMMY,I bought CDs for the broken record lady. I didn't drive my sisters out of state.
155,TOMMY,I expect to see you at Tommy Jr.'s dinner tonight with.the baked ziti.
156,LIVIA,Only if someone picks me up and drives me home. I don't drive when they're predicting rain.
157,TOMMY,You're a healthy girl. It's. good for you to drive. Use it or lose it. I have to get back to work.
158,LIVIA,Sure. Run off.
159,TOMMY,That night it was my son's birthday party.
160,TOMMY,Maybe I should go get my mother.
161,CARMELA,No way. She's jerking your chain.
162,FATHER PHIL,"You had a recipe for creme anglais all the time, Carmela. Right here in 'Julia Child'."
163,FATHER PHIL,"Oh, hi, Tony. You like creme anglais?"
164,TOMMY,"You bless it, I'll eat it."
165,TOMMY,Grandma's not coming. She started crying and hung up.
166,TOMMY,She needs a purpose in life.
167,CARMELA,Your mother's tougher than you think.
168,TOMMY,No fucking ziti now?
169,BOTH PARENTS,Hey!
170,VOICE,Where's everybody?
171,TOMMY,At first it felt like ginge ale in my skull.
172,CARMELA,"Oh, my God --"
173,TOMMY,Dr. Cusamano put me in the hospital. I had every kind of test.29
174,VOICE,"When you're in the machine, there's a microphone by your head if you get claustrophobia and have to come out. Only we suggest that you don't do that 'cause we'll; only have to start over again from the beginning."
175,TOMMY,Okay.
176,TOMMY,Carmela...?
177,CARMELA,I thought maybe you'd want some company.
178,TOMMY,Thanks. Six-thirty in the morning? How are the kids?
179,CARMELA,Worried about you -- I tolu Tommy Jr. we'd rain check his birthday.
180,TOMMY,"Carm', you think I have a brain tumor?"
181,CARMELA,"Well, we'll find out."
182,TOMMY,What a bedside manner. Very encouraging.
183,CARMELA,"What are you gonna, not know?"
184,TOMMY,"We've had some good times, some good years."
185,CARMELA,Here he goes now with the nostalgia.
186,TOMMY,What I'm saying -- no marriage is perfect.
187,CARMELA,But having that goomar' on the side helps.
188,TOMMY,"I don't see her anymore, I told you. How do you think I like it, having that priest in my house all the time?"
189,CARMELA,Don't even go there. Father is a spiritual mentor -- he's helping me to be a better catholic.
190,TOMMY,We all have different needs.
191,CARMELA,What's different between you and me is you're going to Hell when you die.
192,TOMMY,"My nephew, Christopher, was handling the garbage contract problem while I was in the hospital. On this here also you don't need to know the details."
193,CHRIS,Yeah?
194,KOLAR,Emil. Kolar.
195,CHRIS,"Money, hope this don't give you indigestion. It's private here like we need. To talk."
196,KOLAR,"In the Czech Republic, too, we love pork. You ever have our sausages?"
197,CHRIS,"I thought the only_sausages were italian and Jimmy Deans. See what you learn when.you cross culture and shit'?	."
198,KOLAR,My Uncle Evzen doesn't know I came. But if we make any progress here tonight I will have to tell him.
199,CHRIS,"We have to make progress, Email. We must stop the madness. The garbage business is changing. We're the younger generation. We have issues in common."
200,KOLAR,Emil.
201,CHRIS,Where'd you go to high school? Poland.
202,KOLAR,I'm not Polish.
203,CHRIS,"Well, what's Czechoslovakian? Isn't that a type of polack?"
204,KOLAR,We came to this country when I was nine. I went to West Essex.
205,CHRIS,"Yo, money. My cousin Anthony's school used to play you in football. He went to Boonton."
206,KOLAR,Where's the...?
207,CHRIS,"Ah, yes, the reason for the visit."
208,CHRIS,"Taste the wares, Email"
209,CHRIS,Can you see him yet? Has he arrived where you are?
210,TOMMY,The doctors kept me hanging about the neurological tests. My Uncle Junior and I played a round of golf and then had lunch.
211,MELFI,In what way is your uncle a problem for you?
212,JUNIOR,Who do you think you are?
213,TOMMY,The guy who says how things go is who I think I am. Artie's dinner business is nice upscale people from.the suburbs. Don't ruin his life.
214,BEPPY,Vesuvio is where Pussy feels safe! He's been eating there for years.
215,TOMMY,Kill him someplace else.ï¿½
216,JUNIOR,"You may run North Jersey, but you don't run your Uncle Junior -- how many fuckin' hours did I spend playing .catch with you	?"
217,MELFI,Why don't weï¿½ï¿½ï¿½moveï¿½off your uncle and.onto your more significant others.
218,TOMMY,"My wife and my daughter were also not getting along and somehow this always trickles down to me.	*"
219,FATHER PHIL,Darn but these laser disks are incredible.
220,CARMELA,Tony watches 'Godfather 2' all the time. He says the camera work looks just as good as in the movie theater.
221,MELFI,In what way is your uncle a problem for you?
222,JUNIOR,Who do you think iyou are?
223,TOMMY,The guy who says. how things go is who I think I am. Artie's dinnerï¿½ business is nice upscale people .from.... the suburbs. Don't ruin his life. ï¿½
224,BEPPY,Vesuvio is where. Pussy feels safe! He's been eating there for years.
225,TOMMY,Kill him someplace else
226,JUNIOR,"You may-run North Jersey, but you don't run your Uncle Junior -- how many fuckin' hours did I spend playing catch with you ï¿½ ?"
227,MELFI,You keep bringing tip this uncle. What about your immediate family? They're more important to the work here.
228,TOMMY,My wife and daughter aren't gettjng along.
229,FATHER PHIL,Darn but these laser disks are incredible.
230,CARMELA,"Tommy watches 'Godfather 2, all the time. He says the camera work looks just as good as in the movie-ï¿½theater."
231,FATHER PHIL,Where does Tony rank 'Goodfellas'?
232,FATHER PHIL,You have raccoons?
233,CARMELA,Too heavy. Someone's walking!
234,FATHER PHIL,Jeez Louise...
235,CARMELA,Hold it!
236,CARMELA,Meadow...?
237,CARMELA,What are you doing?
238,MEADOW,"I noticed this glass rattles every time I walk to the laundry room. Do we have any...what do you call, putty?"
239,CARMELA,Don't give me that. You snuck out.
240,TOMMY JR,What's going on?
241,MEADOW,You locked my bedroom window on purpose so I'd get caught!
242,CARMELA,Normal people thought you were upstairs doing your homework. You're becoming a master of lying and conniving.
243,TOMMY JR,Right in front of Father.
244,FATHER PHIL,Guys. Let's dial down the casting stones a few notches.
245,MEADOW,You're so strict about curfew I have to sneak out.
246,CARMELA,Don't start with me with what other parents allow. You're in the Soprano household.
247,MEADOW,I know I'm grounded. But Patrick's swim meet is tomorrow and he needed me.
248,CARMELA,"For this? Grounded'? Oh, no. You're not.going to Aspen with Hunter. Scangarelo -- that's where you're not going.	-"
249,MEADOW,"Okay, mom. If this is the way you want it..."
250,TOMMY,"But, look, this shit I'm telling you, it'll all blow over."
251,MELFI,Didn't you admit to Dr. Cusamano you were feeling depressed?
252,TOMMY,"Melfi. What part of The Boot, hon?"
253,MELFI,My father's people were from Caserta.
254,TOMMY,Avellino. My mother would have loved it if you and I had hooked up.
255,MELFI,"Anxiety attacks are a legitimate psychiatric emergency. Suppose you were driving and passed out.	*"
256,TOMMY,"Let me tell you something today everybody goes to shrinks and counselors. Everybody goes on Sally Jesse Raphael and talks about their problems.Whatever happened to Gary Cooper? The strong silent type. That was an American. He wasn't in touch with his feelings. He just did what he had to do!Unfortunately, what they didn't know was once they got Gary Cooner in touch with his feelings, they wouldn't be able to shut him up! Dysfunction this! Dysfunction that! Dysfunction va fangool'!"
257,MELFI,You have strong feelings about this.
258,TOMMY,"Let me tell you something -- I understand Freud. I had a semester	and a half of college. So, sure, I get therapy as a concept. But in my world it doesn't go down."
259,TOMMY,Could I be a little happier. Sure. Who couldn't?
260,MELFI,Do you feel depressed?
261,TOMMY,"Since the ducks left, I guess."
262,MELFI,The ducks that preceded your losing consciousness. Let's talk about them.
263,HERMAN,Mahaffey does not have the money.
264,CHRIS,What do you mean Mahaffey does not have the money?
265,HERMAN,Mahaffey does not have the money.
266,CHRIS,How could he not have the money?
267,HERMAN,The man does not have the money.
268,CHRIS,We ran over him with the car. T himself --
269,HERMAN,The man has no wiggle room. He is bled dry.
270,HERMAN,so I hear Junior wants to whack Pussy Bonpensiero?
271,TOMMY,Pussy Malanga.
272,HERMAN,"Oh, Little Pussy..."
273,TOMMY,"Yeah, Little Pussy. You .think he's going to fuck with Big Pussy?ï¿½ My Pussy?"
274,SILVIO,"Sandrine, this table, drinks ,on thE house, all nightï¿½"
275,HERMAN,Your uncle resents that you are boss.
276,SILVIO,The sadness acrues.
277,HERMAN,"Junior's had a hard-on all his life -- first, that your father, his younger brother, was a made guy before him? Now you? So, sure, he can't stomach you telling him what todo."
278,TOMMY,Yet I love him.
279,HERMAN,The.man is driven in toto by his insecurities. He register the beef with New York?
280,TOMMY,He's got their okay-on the hit.
281,SILVIO,I feel bad I was the messenger.
282,HERMAN,Your friend with the restaurant -ï¿½ send his sinuses to Arizona. Get him .out ..of town for three weeks. This way the restaurant closes. The hit has to go down somewhere else.
283,TOMMY,"No wonder my old man relied on you, you fuckin' Jew."
284,HERMAN,What about the fuckin' Jew's two fifty on Mahaffey's .hundred
285,TOMMY,"Mahaffey now has a business.. partner. You. Every day these HMOsï¿½ payï¿½ï¿½ out millions in claims. Doctors, hospitalsï¿½..a fuckin' MRI costs a grand ï¿½PPPï¿½ We give Mahaffey a choice--ï¿½ he either has his companystart paying out on phoney claims -ï¿½ to fake clinics we set up -- or he pays Hesh the two hundred and fifty thousand he owes -- which we know he cannot do -- or it's a fuckin' rainy night in Lyndhurst."
286,HERMAN,That's very smart. This could be major.
287,TOMMY,Could be as good as garbage.
288,CHRIS,Garbage is our bread and butter
289,TOMMY,Was.
290,TOMMY,"Wow,. look at this, mom."
291,DIRECTOR,"Our lecture series in action -- today it's someone from the university, they're discussing_the novels of I believe -- Zori Neale Hurston."
292,CARMELA,"Didn't you just read her in school, Med'?"
293,TOMMY JR,"This place is neat, grandma. You should really think about this."
294,LIVIA,What's going on behind there?
295,DIRECTOR,Those doors lead to our nursing unit.
296,LIVIA,This is a nursing home!
297,DIRECTOR,"This is a residence, but just in case"
298,LIVIA,"You're not putting me in a nursing home! I've seen these women in these nursing homes, babbling like idiots!"
299,TOMMY,You're not listening -- what the lady said was --
300,LIVIA,"You think you're pretty high and mighty here, don't you, with your fancy authors!"
301,LIVIA,People come here to die. If your father saw what you're doing.
302,BIG PUSSY,"You can't blame T. for being pissed you whacked this kid. You should have waited for me, Christopher."
303,CHRIS,"Last time I show any fuckin' initiative. And then -- can you imagine, Pussy, how I felt when T.	runs down the garbage business. And I just fuckin' wet a guy to help hold on to one of our stops."
304,BIG PUSSY,"He's not running it down. It's just	gettin' harder in New York. Sure T.	wants to keep any contracts we got.	*"
305,CHRIS,"So. Kolar Sanitation'll finally get the message. Ready?	\"
306,BIG PUSSY,Out of breath.
307,CHRIS,One...two…
308,CHRIS,three!
309,BIG PUSSY,Fuck.
310,CHRIS,One...two...three
311,BIG PUSSY,Let's just sit him up against it.
312,CHRIS,It's better if he's in it.
313,BIG PUSSY,"What are you, fuckin' Michelangelo? Sit him up against it or I'm gonna get really pissed off here now."
314,BIG PUSSY,Wait a minute -- this is fucked up.
315,CHRIS,"What, Pussy?"
316,BIG PUSSY,The uncle's gonna find the kid dead on one of his bins and get out of our fuckin' business?
317,CHRIS,Louis Brassi sleeps with the fishes.'
318,BIG PUSSY,Luca Brassi. Luca.
319,CHRIS,Whatever.
320,BIG PUSSY,"There's differences,. Christopher, okay? From situation to situation.The Kolars know the kid is dead, it hardens their position. Plus, nowthe cops are looking for a fuckin' murderer."
321,CHRIS,Whatever.
322,BIG PUSSY,"The kid disappears, never comes they know but they don't know. hope maybe he'll turn up. IF."
323,CHRIS,"Pussy, T. with these mental seizures or whatever. If he kept getting worse, what would you do? ï¿½	*"
324,BIG PUSSY,I'm gonna tell you?
325,MELFI,So you'.ve come back for help. Don't 1ook at that as a defeat.
326,TOMMY,"You can't imagine the humiliation.Beautiful retirement center I'm gonna	spend five thousand a month on and she's yelling and screaming like a cafone."
327,MELFI,"For us baby boomers, dealing with our parents' aging is extremely painful."
328,TOMMY,She's part of that generation raised in the Depression. But for her the Depression was a trip to Six Flags.
329,MELFI,There's that 'D' word again.
330,MELFI,Eighteen million .Americans are clinically depressed.
331,TOMMY,What's happened to society? Everything's broken down.
332,MELFI,We're not here to talk about society. We're here to talk about you. Stay with your mother.
333,TOMMY,Now that my father's dead? He's a saint. When he was alive?
334,TOMMY,My dad was tough. Ran his crew. Guy like that and my mother wore him down to a little nub. He was a squeaking gerbilrwhen he died.
335,MELFI,Quite a formidable maternal presence.
336,TOMMY,"I might as well be honest -- I'm finding much of the satisfaction gone fromï¿½my work, too."
337,MELFI,Why?
338,TOMMY,Probably be.cause of RICO.
339,MELFI,Is he your brother?
340,TOMMY,The RICO statutes.
341,MELFI,Oh...of course... Right.
342,TOMMY,You read the papers. How the Justice Department is using RICO and these legal strategies and electronic technology to squeeze our business.
343,MELFI,Do you ever have any qualms about how you actually make your living?
344,TOMMY,"I find I have to be the sad clown -- upbeat on the outside, crying on the inside.See, things are trending downward. Used to be, guy got pinched, he took his prison jolt no matter what.Everybody upheld the code of silence.Nowadays?.. No values. Guys today have no room in their life for the penal experience. So you get allthis turning government witness."
345,MELFI,I see.
346,TOMMY,I feel exhausted just talking about it.
347,MELFI,"Well -- with today's pharmacology, No one needs to suffer ï¿½with feelings exhaustion or depression."
348,TOMMY,Here we go...here comes the Prozac.
349,CARMELA,Miss Meadow.
350,MEADOW,I'm not going.
351,CARMELA,"Every year on this date since you were itty-bitty, Mom and Meadow get all dolled up and drive to the Plaza for tea under Eloise's portrait. Look --Where's yours?"
352,MEADOW,I have too much homework.
353,CARMELA,"Med', it's our little tradicion. We always have so much fun."
354,MEADOW,"Tell you the truth, I've dumb since I was eight. I just go because you like it."
355,CARMELA,And here I thought it was something we'd do long after you were married. With girls of your own.
356,MEADOW,"Hopefully, I won't be living anywhere around here by then."
357,COMPUTER VOICE,Check your mailbox!ï¿½
358,CARMELA,"Meadow, you can't lie and cheat and just break the rules you don't like."
359,CARMELA,What? Is there something you want to say'?
360,MEADOW,"Look, mom, do you have any idea how much it means to actually go skiing in Aspen? You think that's going to happen every year? Like lame tea and scones at the Plaza Hotel?"
361,CARMELA,Good-bye.
362,MEADOW,"Close my door, please."
363,TOMMY,"Listen, Artie, I wonder if you could help me out."
364,ARTHUR,What?
365,TOMMY,"Cruise -- Caribbean -- S.S. Sagafjord, 11th through the 29th. Pair of tickets..ï¿½I can't use them. Can you take them off my he.ï¿½ds?"
366,ARTHUR,Where are they from?
367,CHRIS,Comps.
368,ARTHUR,"What does that mean, 'comps?'"
369,TOMMY,"In my position as business agent for the Kitchen and Restaurant Workers Union, it's my responsibility to administer the dental plan. The dentists awarded us these in appreciation. Problem is,	can't get away those dates."
370,TOMMY,When's the last time you closed up and got away for a couple weeks?
371,CHARMAINE,You can't accept a gift like that from Tommy Soprano.
372,ARTHUR,Don't you tell me what I can and cannot do.
373,CHARMAINE,Go ahead. Wind up in jail.
374,ARTHUR,"Charmaine, don't talk like an idiot. Three weeks..all expense paid. I'm telling you, if I have to put my hand up the ass of one more chicken without a break, I'm gonna go post office."
375,CHARMAINE,"I don't wish to talk about it, Arthur."
376,CHARMAINE,Art...Melissa...time to go home.
377,ARTHUR,"Honey, you have to get away -- we have to.. For our marriage."
378,CHARMAINE,No. It's bad enough these mobsters still patronize the place.
379,ARTHUR,"Yeah, but so what? We're not connected."
380,CHARMAINE,Right. Because we just turned down those tickets.
381,ARTHUR,Tom's a labor leader. The tickets were comps.
382,CHARMAINE,"Oh, Arthurï¿½, grow up. Does not the mind rebel at any possible scenario under which dentists send the don of Newï¿½ Jersey first class on a Norwegian steamship?"
383,CHARMAINE,Somebody donated some kneecaps for those tickets.
384,MAHAFFEY,"Herman. There is no way I can subvert my fucking company... Have them pay claims for MRI's that never happened. ,..	*"
385,BIG PUSSY,We'll set up MRI clinics that are just shells. The paperwork will look fantastic.
386,MAHAFFEY,How do I not get caught?!
387,HERMAN,"Alex, I don't like to see you knocking yourself like that. You'r@ a smart guy."
388,MAHAFFEY,"I'm depressed...I'm so fucking depressed...I can't eat, sleep..."
389,HERMAN,You on Prozac?
390,MAHAFFEY,Zoloft. Similar. It's supposed to help with the gambling too.
391,BIG PUSSY,No shit?
392,MAHAFFEY,These new seratonin reuptake inhibitor anti-depressants are useful against compulsive-behaviors.
393,BIG PUSSY,That's a shame. A medication comes along after your gambling gets your fucking hip-busted to shit.
394,MAHAFFEY,I'm trying not to be cynical.
395,HERMAN,"You're going to have a chance to make good. Because, Alex, your debt and the feelings accompanying it are the source of all these problems. You know it, I know it."
396,MAHAFFEY,"I'm sorry I haven't paid you, Herman."
397,HERMAN,I know you are.
398,MAHAFFEY,And I certainly never meant to denigrate Tony Soprano.
399,HERMAN,"Want to walk out on the rocks?	*"
400,MAHAFFEY,The -- the crutches -
401,HERMAN,We'll help youï¿½ï¿½ï¿½it's beautiful out there. ! go there to think.
402,MAHAFFEY,"It's okay...no, look...let's...let's try it...what you were saying before."
403,PAULIE WALNUTS,T.?
404,PAULIE WALNUTS,Dick's looking for you.
405,DICK BARONE,I just heard from Triboro Towers. Kolar withdrew the bid.
406,TOMMY,"Hey, that's good anyway.	*"
407,DICK BARONE,"Artie Bucco's here to see y u.	*"
408,TOMMY,"You all right, Artie?"
409,TOMMY,What are you talking about? You need to leave town. We discussed this.
410,ARTHUR,Melissa's in a dance recital.
411,ARTHUR,I'm sorry.
412,TOMMY,"Hey, you can't go, you can't go. You're making a big mistake."
413,ARTHUR,Thank you. I mean that.
414,TOMMY,This fuckin' thing again. How do I help my friend? Huh?
415,TOMMY,The fuck you sulking about?
416,TOMMY,The fuck's with him?
417,PAULIE WALNUTS,Probably shooting fuckin' crank again.
418,TOMMY,Where's the maturity? That's what I want to know.
419,NILS,This is outrageous. I had an eight o'clock reservation I made a month ago.
420,HOSTESS,"Sir, as I explained, people are not leaving their tables and there's five parties ahead of you.	.."
421,NILS,I tore her a new one.
422,OWNER,"Mr. Soprano, how you doing tonight?"
423,TOMMY,"Hello, how are you?"
424,MELFI,Hello.
425,TOMMY,Come here a lot?
426,MELFI,When possible.
427,TOMMY,Nice to see you.
428,TOMMY,I owe you an apology for not showing up the other day.Turned out to be not so urgent. Those decorating tips you gave me worked.
429,MELFI,Good.
430,NILS,"Do you know who that was!? Well, obviously, you do. Is he a patient?"
431,MELFI,You know I can't say.
432,NILS,"'Decorating tips.' Yeah, right."
433,MELFI,"Nils, shut the fuck up."
434,HOSTESS,"Mr. Berglund, they re setting up your table right now."
435,NILS,Whoa.
436,IRINA,Who was that woman tonight?
437,TOMMY,My decorator.
438,IRINA,"What, you are redoing the garbage dump?"
439,TOMMY,You mess that hat up.ï¿½.
440,TOMMY,Irina...Jesus...
441,IRINA,I know there's something intimate with you and her.
442,TOMMY,"Intimate? No, we talk."
443,OWNER,"Mr. Soprano, bona sera. Months we don't see you. Where you been? Signora."
444,TOMMY,Sometimes life is good.-.
445,CARMELA,Life is often good.
446,TOMMY,This Regaliali for example.
447,CARMELA,"You've been in good.spirits the last couple days.	ï¿½"
448,TOMMY,Carmela...there's something I should confess.
449,TOMMY,What are you doing?
450,CARMELA,Getting my wine in position to throw in your damn face.
451,TOMMY,Always witnthe drama.
452,CARMELA,"Confess will you, please? Get it over with."
453,TOMMY,I'm on Prozac.
454,CARMELA,"Oh, my God..."
455,TOMMY,I'm seeing a therapist.
456,CARMELA,I think that's great! I think that's so wonderful. I think that's so gutsy.ï¿½
457,TOMMY,"Take it easy, will you?"
458,CARMELA,I just think that's very wonderful
459,TOMMY,You'd think I was Hannibal Lecture.
460,CARMELA,"Psychology doesn't address the soul, but it's something, it's a start okay, I'll shut up."
461,TOMMY,"Let me tell you something --you're the only person who knows. I'm telling you because you're my wife, you're the only person in my life I'm completely honest with."
462,TOMMY,Hey. I'm serious. The wrong people knew about this I'd get the steeljacket anti-depressant right in the back of the head.
463,CARMELA,I didn't realize you were that unhappy.
464,TOMMY,"I dunno...my mother...I	dunno..."
465,CARMELA,You told him about your father?
466,TOMMY,"Told who? My therapist? Yeah, I told him."
467,CARMELA,Good. But your mother's the one.
468,TOMMY,"Lately,I feel like my life is out of balance. I feel disconnected...It's…"
469,CARMELA, our existence on earth is a puzzle. My own daughter hates me.
470,TOMMY,"She doesn't hate you, Carm."
471,CARMELA,"She broke my heart, Tommy. We were best friends."
472,TOMMY,Girls and their mothers. She'll come back to you.
473,CARMELA,But who knows if she'll ever get to go to Aspen again.
474,TOMMY,She should have thought about that before she stiffed us on the money-- I mean before she broke curfew.See? What's happening to my mind?
475,MEADOW,Hello?
476,CHRIS,"Jesus, I got through?! No social life?"
477,MEADOW,Blow me. Dad -- !
478,CARMELA,"Here, I brought you my primavera. Your favorite."
479,TOMMY,Yeah
480,CHRIS,"A friend of ours just got back in town.	*"
481,ANNOUNCER VOICE,"Malanga...also known as Little Pussy, was released after questioning, but not before an ugly scene at Newark Airport...	*"
482,YOUNG WOMAN,Are you gonna break somebody's leg?
483,CHRIS,So it's gonna go down soon.
484,TOMMY,I think I figured a way to put this to bed.
485,MELFI,It's not the Prozac.
486,TOMMY,Why not?
487,MELFI,You said you're thinking clearer and your wife told you you seemed better. It's not the medication. Prozac takes several weeks to build up effective levels in the blood.
488,TOMMY,What then?
489,MELFI,Coming here -- talking. Hope comes in many forms.
490,TOMMY,Who's got the time for it?!
491,MELFI,What is it you really want to say to me?
492,TOMMY,"I had a dream last night. My belly button was	philips-head screw. And I was working unscrewing it. And when I got it all the way unscrewed my...my penis fell off. And I'm.. running around with it yelling, trying to find this mechanic used to work on my Lincoln when I drove Lincolns and he was supposed to screw it back on, only this bird swooped down and took it in its beak and flew off wfth it and I woke up."
493,MELFI,What kind of bird?
494,TOMMY,Seagull or something.
495,MELFI,A water bird.
496,TOMMY,I saw 'The Birds' last week on ca;)le. You think maybe that planted the idea?
497,MELFI,What else is a water bird?
498,TOMMY,"Pelican...flamingo -- my father used to say, 'I'll do the flamingo on your head...'...but he meant flamenco the dance."
499,MELFI,What about ducks?
500,TOMMY,The ducks. Those damn ducks.
501,MELFI,What was itï¿½ about those ducks that meant so much to you?
502,TOMMY,Did you know the word for duck in Italian is 'anatra'? So Sinatra probably means 'without ducks'.
503,MELFI,Is that why you blacked out? Ducks and Sinatra?
504,TOMMY,"No.I don't know, it was just a trip having those wild creatures come to my pool to have their babies.I was sad to see them go."
505,TOMMY,"Look at this. Oh, fuck. Now he's crying."
506,MELFI,"Once those ducks had their babies, they became a family."
507,TOMMY,So?
508,TOMMY,"You're right -- that's what I'm full of dread about, that I'm going to lose my familyï¿½. Just like I lost the ducks. It's always with me--"
509,MELFI,What are you afraid's going to happen?
510,TOMMY,I don't know! But something. I don't know!
511,TOMMY AND SILVIO,"Way to go, Falcons!"
512,SILVIO,So when would you need this by?
513,TOMMY,"Right away. Go Meadow, yes!!!"
514,SILVIO,I think I can get a party like that together. Side-out! Side-put!
515,TOMMY,Hey. Ref! Oh-oo!
516,MEADOW,"Mom didn't come? Hi, Mr. Dante!"
517,TOMMY,Mom didn't think you wanted her to. Car's this way.
518,TOMMY,You guys played a good game. Heather Dante -- where'd she get that spike?
519,MEADOW,"Dad, don't you think it's totally unfair what mom is doing? And now, like, making this little movie scene out of it -- the sad mom who, like, ï¿½1ike,can't even come to her daughter's sportsï¿½ event?"
520,MEADOW,Dad...?
521,MEADOW,"Don't you think it's totally out there? I mean, my Aspen trip? What is she thinking?	ï¿½"
522,TOMMY,It's been years since I been here.
523,MEADOW,"Dad, please-ï¿½ talk to her, ï¿½please! This is so stupid.Why are we sitting here?"
524,TOMMY,Your mother feels you have the capacity to be a top student. That you're special. I agree.
525,MEADOW,What do you guys want? Perfection? What are you looking at?
526,TOMMY,Yourï¿½great-grandfather and his brother Frank?. They built this place.
527,MEADOW,Big whoop.
528,TOMMY,Stone and marble workers. Came over from Italy. They built this.
529,MEADOW,"Yeah, right -- two guys."
530,TOMMY,"No, they were just two guys on a crew of...I don't know. Laborers. They didn't design it. But they knew how to build it."
531,TOMMY,Go out now and find me two guys who can even put decent grout around your your bathtub.
532,TOMMY,"--like during Gotti's trial a couple years ago, I said to my mother--"
533,MELFI,"Could I interrupt youï¿½a second? (shifts weight nervously) Am I, y'know, 'okay'? Hearing this?"
534,TOMMY,What? Oh -- Gatti? It worries you?
535,MELFI,"Yes, but I' a doctor. It's my job to treat."
536,TOMMY,Us being compare.
537,MELFI,"Being Italian is irrelevant. I run a psychiatric practice, not a zeppola stand at the feast of San Gennaro."
538,MELFI,You were telling me how-when John Gotti was sent to prison you went into a profound feeling of despair and you said something to your mother.
539,TOMMY,"I don't think so. I don't think I was talking about my mother. I was talking about that cock-suck motherfucker Rudy Giulial"".i and how he's ruined things for lots of p Jple.	*"
540,MELFI,"Is there someone in your early life who raises the same fear and control issues as Mayor Giuliani?	*"
541,TOMMY,"Well, look atï¿½ the clock. Hour's up."
542,MELFI,You can answer the question.
543,MELFI,That's outside the boundaries of what we do here.
544,TOMMY,You're the most fantastic woman I've ever seen.
545,MELFI,I'm not going to kick you out of therapy so stop trying.
546,MEADOW,Yes! Yes!
547,CARMELA,Guests are arriving and the table isn't set.How many cups of coffee have you had?
548,MEADOW,Be right there.
549,MEADOW,You mean I can go to Aspen?
550,CARMELA,"Christmas break is just that A break. When you get back to school, you'll really apply yourself."
551,MEADOW,I was just thinking I probably shouldn't go. So close to finals.
552,CARMELA,Excuse me?
553,MEADOW,I was just writing in my journal -ï¿½ how somebody in this family has to do something.
554,CARMELA,Well...About what?
555,MEADOW,Perfection. Earthly perfection. It's a Soprano tradition.
556,CARMELA,It is?
557,MEADOW,I may become a nun. I have to look up our family motto...I think the Web has a genealogy bulletin board.
558,ARTHUR,You work and work so damn hard and then to have your life's dream burn down.
559,TOMMY,Look at it this way -- at least you collect the insurance.
560,PAULIE WALNUTS,"You got to say to yourself, 'It could have been worse.'"
561,ARTHUR,How? How could it be worse? Fucking faulty stove!
562,CHRIS,Suppose people stopped coming to the restaurant. Suppose...I dunno.
563,TOMMY,There's no insurance for that.
564,ARTHUR,Why would people stop coming to the restaurant? It's just starting to. catch on.
565,TOMMY,Know what I'm figuring out lately? Talking helps. Hope comes in many formsï¿½
566,TOMMY,"I'll always help you, Artie."
567,TOMMY,Someday I'll tell him we torched the restaurant as the best solution. Enough of this shit. What's the matter?
568,CHRIS,"A simple, 'way to go, Chris' on the Triboro Towers contract would have been nice."
569,TOMMY,You're right. I have no defense. It's from how I was parented. Never complimented or supported.
570,CHRIS,My cousin Anthony's girlfriend is what they call a developmer-t girl out in Hollywood. She said I could sell my life story for fuckin' millions. But I didn't. I stuck with you.
571,TOMMY,Hey. I'll fuckin' kill you. You gonna go. Henry Hill on me now? Too many wiseguys are making book deals and causing all kinds of shit.
572,CHRIS,She said maybe I could even play myself.
573,TOMMY,"Forget Hollywood screenplays.	Forget those distractions. You think I haven't had offers? Hear me? We got work to do. New avenues. Everything's gonna be fine from here on. If we don't lose who we are. Look. It's a beautiful day."
574,LIVIA,"It was nice of you the party, Junior. cares about me."
575,JUNIOR,These kids today.
576,LIVIA,"I suppose he thinks once he's got me locked away in a nursing home I'll die faster, then he won't have to drive me anywhere."
577,LIVIA,If his father was still around you can bet your boots he'd show decency and respect for his mother.
578,JUNIOR,"Well, my brother John was a man among men."
579,LIVIA,He was a saint.
580,JUNIOR,"Hey, if he could steal you away from me he musta been something...anyway, lots of things are different now from Johnny's and my day."
581,LIVIA,What do you mean?
582,JUNIOR,I'm not free to run my business like I want.
583,LIVIA,Isn't that awful.
584,JUNIOR,"just this week your son stuck his hand in -- 'course, I can't prove it was him -- made it a hundred times more difficult for me. Plus, he thumbs his nose at.New York."
585,JUNIOR,What are you gonna do? He's part of a whole generation. Remember the crazy hair? And the dope? Now it's fags in the military.
586,LIVIA,"Stop it, Junior, you're making me very upset!"
587,JUNIOR,"I don't like to, Livia, but I'm all agita all the time. And I'll tell you something else. Things are down. All across the board."
588,JUNIOR,"A lot of friends of ours are complaining. We used to be recessionï¿½ proof? No more. You can't blame it all on the Justice Department.Our friends say to me, 'Junior, why don't you take a larger hand in things?'"
589,JUNIOR,"Something may have to be done, Livia, about Tom. I don't know."
590,TOMMY,"There they are! Hi, ma!"
591,LIVIA,"What, you're.using that mesquite? It makes the sausage, taste peculiar."
592,TOMMY JR,"Hi, grandma!"
593,LIVIA,"He1lo,. my big boy."
594,TOMMY,"Carmela, my mother's here."
595,CARMELA,"Okay, let's eat everybody!"
