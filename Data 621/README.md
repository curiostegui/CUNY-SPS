**DATA 621: Business Analytics and Data Mining**  

**Instructor Name:** Jeffrey L. Edwards <br/>
**Degree Program:** M.S. in Data Science <br/>
**Credits:** 3 graduate credits <br/>
**Prerequisites:** DATA 607; Data 606 <br/>
**Type of Course:** Required course

**Course Description**

This course develops the foundations of predictive modeling by introducing the key concepts of applied regression modeling and its extensions. The main topics covered in this course include: simple and multiple linear regression, variable selection and shrinkage methods, binary logistic regression, count regression, weighted least squares, robust regression, generalized least squares, multinomial logistic regression, generalized linear models, panel regression, and nonparametric regression. The course is heavily weighted towards practical application using the R statistical programming language and data sets containing missing values and outliers. The course also addresses issues of exploratory data analysis, data preparation, model development, model validation, and model deployment. 

**Program Learning Outcomes:**
-	Business Understanding. Students will learn how applied regression modeling techniques can add value to existing business analytics.
-	Data Programming. Use industry standard statistical programming tools.
-	Foundational Math and Statistics. Emphasis on probability, statistics, and computational methods.
-	Data Culture. Students will learn how applied regression modeling can enhance business capabilities and extend the value of existing data.
-	Data Understanding. Students will learn how to explore data to find new patterns.
-	Predictive Modeling. Selecting predictive modeling techniques, building and assessing models.
-	Model Implementation. Students will learn to implement models for the various applied regression modeling techniques covered in the course.

**Learning Objectives:**
-	Demonstrate a practical understanding of the theoretical concepts behind applied regression modeling.
-	Analyze and select appropriate types and combinations of models given particular business situations.
-	Develop applied regression modeling techniques to address different types of data.
-	Use R statistical software to build and deploy specific models based on real-world business problems.

**How is this course relevant for IS and data analytics professionals?**
Regression modeling skills are crucial, high-value skills in todayâ€™s data-driven business environment where real-world decision-making processes are complex. The ability to leverage rapidly expanding data sets to obtain new insights is at the heart of predictive data analytics. 

**How does this course work?**

The course is conducted entirely online via Blackboard. Each week, the student will complete assigned readings from the required textbooks, watch lecture videos, complete optional (but recommended) textbook exercises, complete homework assignments (not weekly), and participate in the discussion board. There is also a final course project. Students are expected to complete all deliverables by their assigned due dates.

**Assignments and Grading**

| Course assignments | Precentage of Final Grade | Points |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Homework Assignments (Group Assignment)** | 50% | 500 |
| - There will be 5 homework assignments (10% each, or 100 points each) used to re-enforce course concepts and provide implementation experience in R.  | | |
| **Final Project** | 30% | 300 |
| - Students will form a group of 3 -5 people. <br/> - Each group will submit a project. <br/> -	The project will require students to model a problem using any of the methods learned in this course | | |
| **Class Discussion (Individual Assignment)** | 20% | 200 |
| -	Each week, we will have a topic to discuss. <br/> -	A student is required to participate by introducing a question. <br/> -	A total of 5 blog entries will be required throughout the semester based on a topic of your choice where a student shares his or her thoughts on a statistical method and how that can be used in a real life scenario based on your daily life experience. <br/> -	These need to be completed by the end of the semester|  |  |
| **Total** | **100%** | **1,000** |


**Discussion Board Etiquette:**

The purpose of the discussion board in general is to allow students to freely exchange ideas. It is imperative to remain respectful of all viewpoints and positions and, when necessary, agree to respectfully disagree. While active and frequent participation is encouraged, cluttering a discussion board with inappropriate, irrelevant, or insignificant material will not earn additional points and may result in receiving less than full credit. Frequency is not unimportant, but content of the message is paramount. Please remember to cite all sources (when relevant) in order to avoid plagiarism.

**Late Policy:**
Unless otherwise noted, all work is due on the assigned day by 11:59 PM (Eastern Time). This includes homework assignments, projects, and participation in the discussions. In case of an extenuating circumstance, we can make exception. Please be sure to contact me ahead of time.

**Required Texts**
-	A Modern Approach to Regression with R, by Simon J. Sheather. ISBN 978-0-387-09608-7 (MARR)
-	Linear Models with R, by Julian J. Faraway. ISBN 978-1439887332 (LMR)

**Relevant Software:**

The primary software environment is the R statistical programming language, which can be downloaded for free from http://www.r-project.org. RStudio is the recommended interface for the R statistical programming language software, which can also be downloaded for free at http://www.rstudio.org.

**Note on Timing Communications:**

Office hours are conducted via GoToMeeting or phone. You are encouraged to ask questions on the course discussion board where other students will be able to benefit from your inquiries. For the most part, you can expect me to respond to questions by email within 24 to 48 hours. If you do not hear back from me within 48 hours of sending an email, please resend your email. You can expect me to grade and return assignments within 14 days. Please do not hesitate to ask if you have questions or concerns.
