Welcome to DATA 602 and one of the hottest subjects in the technology market today - Data science with Python. I hope to help you get the most out of this 15-week journey! Ready? Let us get started!

## Course Description

This course will provide you with advanced programming techniques in data manipulation, data analysis, basic machine learning and visualization of data. We will rely on Python 3.7.x to study these techniques. Prior knowledge of Python is not required. The course will require a combination of reading, watching videos, class participation via Blackboard discussion board and 8 coding assignments. The requirements for this course are detailed below*.* Our reading material will include selected chapters from 3 books and a mix of required and optional reading of documentation online. All books are available free.

## Course Objectives:

1.  Learn or review Python core concepts and data structures.
2.  Learn data science-specific Python packages like NumPy, pandas, matplotlib and sci-kit learn.
3.  Learn about basic machine learning.
4.  Build data-oriented applications that combine data analysis.
5.  Gain exposure to real world tools and techniques.

**PREREQUISITE KNOWLEDGE**

Intermediate level knowledge of programming concepts is required. If you have never programmed before, please send me an email to discuss. Prior knowledge of Python is not required.

**Week by Week Dashboard**

For your convenience, I put together a spreadsheet that tracks what needs to be done week by week, giving you a bird's eye view and roadmap of the course. The spreadsheet should allow you to think about how you need to pace yourself and is a dashboard of sorts to the class. The spreadsheet can be accessed by clicking here: https://bit.ly/2Q2bQtw

Please remember if there are any conflicts between any other source of information, like the tracker spreadsheet, and this syllabus then this syllabus is what should be followed, except if there is an announcement making an adjustment.

**Definition of School Week**

Deadlines are established by school week and not calendar week. A school week is defined every semester by CUNY SPS. For example, if the first day of class this semester is Friday then the end of school week is Thursday midnight EST. All deadlines for deliverables in this course are based on school week and not calendar week.

**Required: Assignments**

There are 8 coding assignments.

Each assignment will require you to fill in code inside of template code. Each assignment will also have a test harness written in Python that checks your code works correctly using some minimum standard. Passing the test harness should not be construed to be an indicator of your grade on the assignment but an indicator that some minimum level of checks have succeeded. Instructions for each assignment are embedded in the template. Assignments will increase in difficulty over the weeks.

**SUBMITTING ASSIGNMENTS**

An assignment is considered submitted when you post a link of the private Github repository containing your work. To submit an assignment, scroll down to below the assignment description and click on "Write Submission" and paste in your Github URL. The timestamp of the submission will be used to determine if it was made before the deadline. The link you post must meet the following requirements:

1.  The link must point to the Github repository where you have pushed your code for the assignment. **This repository must be private and** **have** the Github user **data602sps** (me) **added as a collaborator**. Please do not commit any code into the repository past the deadline date, doing so will invalidate your entire submission.
2.  To create a repository that contains a copy of the assignment files, you can either:
    1.  Fork the assignment Github repository.
    2.  Clone the assignment repo and push to your repository.
    3.  Download the assignment from the Github web page and copy into your local folder and then push to your Github repository.
3.  Keep all your assignments within the same single Github repository.
4.  Keep the file names exactly the same as the template file names.
5.  A GitHub link to specifically the assignment file in your GitHub repository MUST be submitted into Blackboard grade center. If you do not submit it, you will not get credit for the assignment.
6.  Any late submissions will be docked at 5 points per 24 hours with a maximum extension of 96 hours. Any submission after 96 hours will be marked with a grade of zero. There is no exception to this rule.

**THERE IS A ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY FOR PLAGIARISM. KEEP YOUR WORK PRIVATE AND TO YOURSELF ONLY.**

**Important** - Please remember - your Github repository must be **private**.

**ASSIGNMENT RUBRIC**

The following rubric is used to grade each assignment.

| **Rubric**           | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                    |

**OFFICE HOURS**

Office hours will be conducted every other Thursday at 7PM. Since we will have an active Slack group, office hours sessions may not occur on a regular basis but on a need basis, with at least 3 sessions guaranteed to occur - Week 1, middle of the semester and end of semester. **A single session will be held for all sections of DATA 602**, if more than one section exists. We will be using Blackboard's Collaborate tool to conduct office hours. To be useful to all participants, office hours should be used to discuss issues that cannot be resolved via Blackboard’s Discussion Board or Slack. If you have an installation problem or are getting a Python error, you cannot resolve then that might not be the best topic to raise on a call with the rest of the class. However, if you have questions on the requirements for the assignments that all participants can benefit from then please do bring it up.

**OFFICE HOURS RECORDINGS**

All office hours will be audio recorded using Blackboard Collaborate. Recordings are generally available within a few hours after the event but are downloaded and placed in the class Dropbox within 24 business hours.
