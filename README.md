Assignments from the Masters in Data Science Program at CUNY SPS will posted here. Below you will find the degree requirements and description of the classes.
## Degree Requirements
- **Core Required Courses**
  - **DATA 602 Advanced Programming Techniques**
    - Students will learn aspects of contemporary programming that are important for data gathering and analysis, including real-time programming, GUI design, interactive database programming, service-oriented architecture, data collection with and without databases, machine learning, data mining techniques, and GIS programming.
  - **DATA 605 Fundamentals of Computational Mathematics**
    - This course covers basic differential and integral calculus from the viewpoint of numerical methods and some basic probability concepts. .
  - **DATA 606 Statistics and Probability for Data Analytics**
    - This course covers basic techniques in probability and statistics that are important in the field of data analytics. Discrete probability models, sampling from infinite and finite populations, statistical distributions, basic Bayesian statistics, and non-parametric statistical techniques for categorical data are covered. 
  - **Data 607 Data Acquisition and Management**
    - Course covers core concepts of contemporary data collection and its management. Topics will include systems for collecting data (real time, sensors, open data sets, etc..) and implications for practice; types of data (textual, quantitative, qualitative, GIS, etc..) and sources; an overview of the use of data, including what and how much should be collected and the distinction between data, information, and knowledge from a data-centric point of view; provenance; managing data with and without databases; computer and data security; data cleaning, fusing, and processing techniques; combining data from different sources; storage techniques including very large data sets; and storing data keeping in mind privacy and security issues.
  - **Data 608 Knowledge and Visual Analytics**
    - The course covers non-statistical aspects of elucidating from data its information content, which leads to knowledge. Several differing visual techniques will be examined to gain this knowledge through exploratory use of visualizations as well as visualization techniques for presenting data to a variety of stakeholders; exploratory techniques look to find patterns in the data; and finding patterns that underlie the system's characteristics when the data sets are very large or have many dimensions by.
  - **Data 621 Business Analytics and Data Mining**
    - This course teaches students to comb through complex business data sets to produce knowledge, and ultimately, business intelligence. Students learn the basics of business analytics. However, this course goes well beyond typical analytics for managers by including rich computational components for predictive and prescriptive analytics. Strategy and operational business contexts are provided via case studies throughout the course. Students will deal with actual business scenarios like sales, marketing, logistics, and finance.
  - **Data 698 Analytics Master's Research Project**
    - students will integrate the knowledge and skills derived from the previous classes into a real-world project. Working in small teams (that may be geographically distributed) or by themselves, students will work on designing an information system.With the oversight of a faculty advisor, students will identify a topic, develop a research plan, conduct research, and collect and analyze data.
